# Introduction

Welcome to the Linkfire API! You can use our API to access Linkfire API endpoints, which can get information on various boards and links in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, PHP (coming soon), and AngularJS (coming soon)! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
